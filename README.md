# photo-calendar

A web app to display photos from social media, grouped by day, in a calendar grid display format.

This project is my submission for [\#GodamSahur](https://sahur.dev/).

## Idea

As a social media user, 
- I want to create photo-of-the-day type of activities.
- I want to label days that have significant value, and able to see photos associated with the events.
- I want to see when did I actively posted photos, which may associated with significant events.
